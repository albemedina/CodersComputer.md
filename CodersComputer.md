There is so much information at your disposal to where you can go on a search engine like Bing (but no one really uses Bing except as an april fools joke to google) or Google to help you find a website that you are looking for. For Software developers its like taking a bunch of tools from toolshed and building your base from down on up.

# Text Editors? Do we text an Editor?.md
Theres a bunch of tools you use to help *style* how you want to build your websites. Below are the following examples that are coders use to help you support your website.
- code completion (to start typing, and the code completionfeature will display possible suggestions based on what you originally typed.)
- syntax highlighting (feature that takes the text you type, and makes it more noticeable by colorizing the text.)
- variety of different themes
- choosing the extensions that you need at the time.

# Examples of text editors
## Note pad++
NotePad++ is a free text editor for Windows Computers only. NotePad++ has been around for many years and many web developers swear by NotePad++. Available for windows only ~(sorry apple)~
## Brackets
Brackets is a free text editor that’s available for download for Windows computers, Mac computers and Linux computers. It’s made and maintained by the good folks at Adobe—yep, the Photoshop people. Brackets only supports HTML, CSS and JavaScript, though more coding capabilities can be added through extensions.
## Sublime Texts
Sublime Text 3 is a premium software that can be purchased in full for $70. Otherwise you’ll use the free version. Sublime Text enjoys a history of being fast and responsive while being extensible as well. There’s no doubt that Sublime Text will tick the check boxes of what to look for in a text editor. It has syntax highlighting, it has code completion, it has themes and extensions. And will definitely get the .job done no matter how advanced you get with your coding.

Does this make you wanna build websites?
